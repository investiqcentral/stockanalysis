It's independent of external factors and instead just relies on the company's ability to generate cash flows. It uses a set of assumptions based on historical data to be able to project how much the company is going to be generating in cash in the next five to ten years. The discount rate, WACC, is used to bring back all the future cash flows to the present. (Discounting thing has to do with the time value of money which is a concept that says that a sum of money today is worth more than a sum of money in the future.) After the forecasted period of say five to ten years, the company doesn't just disintegrate and it keeps on going and keeps on selling. It means that after that forecasted period it is needed to assume a value for it which is known as terminal value (TV). So the terminal value is the value of the company after the forecasted period. Because the calculation is based on historical growth data, the output value is more accurate when the historical data is consistent."
